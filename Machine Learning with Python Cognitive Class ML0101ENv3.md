## Machine Learning with Python Cognitive Class ML0101ENv3

•	Module -1 Machine Learning :
1.	Machine Learning uses algorithms that can learn from data without relying on explicitly programmed methods. — True
2. Which are the two types of Supervised learning techniques? — Classification and Regression Classification and Regression
3. Which of the following statements best describes the Python scikit library — A collection of algorithms and tools for machine learning.

•	Module -2 Regression :
1.	Train and Test on the Same Dataset might have a high training accuracy, but its out-of-sample accuracy can be low. — True
2.	Which of the following matrices can be used to show the results of model accuracy evaluation or the model’s ability to correctly predict or separate the classes? — Confusion matrix
3.	When we should use Multiple Linear Regression? — When we would like to identify the strength of the effect that the independent variables have on a dependent variable.

•	Module -3 Classification :
1.	In K-Nearest Neighbors, — A very high value of K (ex. K = 100) produces an overly generalised model, while a very low value of k (ex. k = 1) produces a highly complex model.
2.	A classifier with lower log loss has better accuracy. — True
3.	When building a decision tree, we want to split the nodes in a way that decreases entropy and increases information gain. — True

•	Module -4 Clustering :
1.	This one is NOT TRUE about k-means clustering — As k-means is an iterative algorithm, it guarantees that it will always converge to the global optimum.
2.	Customer Segmentation is a supervised way of clustering data, based on the similarity of customers to each other. — False
3.	How is a center point (centroid) picked for each cluster in k-means? — We can randomly choose some observations out of the data set and use these observations as the initial means.

•	Module -5 Recommender Systems :
1.	Collaborative filtering is based on relationships between products and people’s rating patterns. — True
2.	Which one is TRUE about Content-based recommendation systems? — Content-based recommendation system tries to recommend items to the users based on their profile.
3.	Which one is correct about user-based and item-based collaborative filtering? — In user-based approach, the recommendation is based on users of the same neighborhood, with whom he/she shares common preferences.

•	Knowledge Test :
1.	You can define Jaccard as the size of the intersection divided by the size of the union of two label sets. — True
2.	When building a decision tree, we want to split the nodes in a way that increases entropy and decreases information gain. — False
3.	CN
4.	To calculate a model’s accuracy using the test set, you pass the test set to your model to predict the class labels, and then compare the predicted values with actual values. — True
5.	Which is the definition of entropy? — The amount of information disorder in the data.
6.	Which of the following is true about hierarchical linkages? — Average linkage is the average distance of each point in one cluster to every point in another cluster 
7.	The goal of regression is to build a model to accurately predict the continues value of a dependent variable for an unknown case. — True
8.	Which of the following statements are true about linear regression? (Select all that apply) — (a)With linear regression, you can fit a line through the data. ; (b) y=a+b_x1 is the equation for a straight line, which can be used to predict the continuous value y.
9.	The Sigmoid function is the main part of logistic regression, where Sigmoid of 𝜃^𝑇.𝑋, gives us the probability of a point belonging to a class, instead of the value of y directly. — True
10.	In comparison to supervised learning, unsupervised learning has: EITHER Less tests (evaluation approaches) 
11.	The points that are classified by Density-Based Clustering and do not belong to any cluster, are outliers. — True
12.	Which of the following is false about Simple Linear Regression? — It is used for finding outliers It is used for finding outliers
13.	Which one of the following statements is the most accurate? — Machine Learning is the branch of AI that covers the statistical and learning part of artificial intelligence.
14.	Which of the following are types of supervised learning? — (a) Classification (b)Regression (c)KNN
15.	A Bottom-Up version of hierarchical clustering is known as Divisive clustering. It is a more popular method than the Agglomerative method. — False
16.	Select all the true statements related to Hierarchical clustering and K-Means. — Hierarchical clustering does not require the number of clusters to be specified.;K-Means is more efficient than Hierarchical clustering for large datasets.
17.	What is a content-based recommendation system? — Content-based recommendation system tries to recommend items to the users based on their profile built upon their preferences and taste.
18.	Before running Agglomerative clustering, you need to compute a distance/proximity matrix, which is an n by n table of all distances between each data point in each cluster of your dataset. — True
19.	CN
20.	In recommender systems, “cold start” happens when you have a large dataset of users who have rated only a limited number of items. — False
